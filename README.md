üëã About Me
I am Bayulu Yakubu, a dedicated physicist with a strong academic foundation and extensive hands-on experience in both theoretical and experimental physics. I hold a BSc in Physics from Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST) and have worked on several innovative projects, including microcontroller programming, sensor interfacing, and real-time monitoring systems.

üî¨ Current Engagement
I am currently enrolled in the ELAIS-QST program, an online course on Quantum Science and Technology offered by the Department of Physics, KNUST in collaboration with the KNUST E-learning Center. My research within this program focuses on:
* Multiparameter Quantum Sensing (MPQS)
* Magnetic Communications
Under the supervision of Prof. Morgan Mitchell, I explore the application of quantum technologies to enhance magnetic communication systems and advance quantum sensor designs.
üõ†Ô∏è Expertise and Research Interests

My work lies at the intersection of:
* Quantum Technologies
* Computational Physics
* Machine Learning
I am passionate about applying these fields to solve real-world challenges in physics and technology. My undergraduate thesis involved developing a real-time liquid level monitoring system using ultrasonic and radar sensors.

üåü Other Projects and Outreach
Developed various IoT and AI-driven projects using microcontrollers and sensors.
Conduct educational outreach programs for high school students, teaching Photonics, Arduino programming, and Sensor Interfacing to inspire the next generation of scientists.
üöÄ Future Goals
I aim to push the boundaries of Quantum Computing, Machine Learning, and Quantum Technologies, contributing to cutting-edge research and innovation.

Feel free to connect with me and explore my projects!
‚ú® "Innovating with passion and shaping the future of physics and technology."
